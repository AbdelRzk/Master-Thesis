A long-lasting goal of artificial intelligence is to design agents capable of cooperative problem-solving. The RoboCup soccer competition provides a challenging environment for investigating the design of such intelligent and autonomous agents using machine learning techniques, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). One crucial aspect of successful gameplay is an effective defensive strategy, namely preventing opponent players from scoring goals. This research aims to investigate the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in learning an effective defensive strategy in the RoboCup soccer competition. Our investigation stands at the intersection of AIâ€™s theoretical aspirations and its practical applications, exploring how MARL can be tailored to enhance team-based defensive tactics.

In this project, we want to learn a defensive behavior in the 2D RoboCup Soccer Simulation in a simplified environment to test Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. But you can use our environment to learn a more general or different behavior. Feel free to reach out if you have any question or suggestions. Also, note that we will be keeping improving the environment as the time goes by to make it more realistic.
